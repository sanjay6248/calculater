Grok is a generative artificial intelligence chatbot developed by xAI. Based on the large language model (LLM) of the same name, it was launched in 2023 as an initiative by Elon Musk.[3] The chatbot is advertised as having a "sense of humor" and direct access to sister platform X, formerly known as Twitter.[4][5][6]

Background
Open AI
Musk co-founded the AI research organization OpenAI with Sam Altman in 2015. Musk left the company's board in 2018, saying of his decision that he "didn't agree with some of what OpenAI team wanted to do".[7]

OpenAI went on to launch ChatGPT in 2022, and GPT-4 in March 2023.

That month, Elon Musk was one of the individuals to sign the "Pause Giant AI Experiments" open letter from the Future of Life Institute, which called for a six-month pause in the development of any AI software more powerful than GPT-4.[8]

TruthGPT
In April 2023, Elon Musk said in an interview on Tucker Carlson Tonight that he intended to develop an AI chatbot called "TruthGPT", which he described as "a maximum truth-seeking AI that tries to understand the nature of the universe".[7]

He expressed concern to Carlson that ChatGPT was being "trained to be politically correct".[9]

Grok
TruthGPT would later become known as "Grok", a verb coined by Robert A. Heinlein in his 1961 science-fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land to describe a form of understanding.[10]

In November 2023, xAI began previewing Grok as a chatbot to selected people,[11] with participation in the early access program being limited to paid X Premium users.[12]

It was announced that once the bot was out of early beta, it would only be available to higher tier X Premium+ subscribers.[13]

At the time of the preview, xAI described the chatbot as "a very early beta product â€“ the best we could do with 2 months of training" that could "improve rapidly with each passing week".[14]

On March 11, 2024, Musk posted on X that the language model would go open source within a week. Six days later, on March 17, Grok-1 was open sourced under the Apache-2.0 license.[15][16] Disclosed were the networks architecture and its weight parameters.[17]

On March 26, 2024, Musk announced that Grok would be enabled for premium subscribers, not just those on the higher-end tier, Premium+.[18]

On March 29, 2024, Grok-1.5 was announced, with "improved reasoning capabilities" and a context length of 128,000 tokens.[19] Grok-1.5 was released to all X Premium users on May 15, 2024.[1]

On April 4, 2024, an update to X's "Explore" page included summaries of breaking news stories written by Grok, a task previously assigned to a human curation team.[20]

On April 12, 2024, Grok-1.5 Vision (Grok-1.5V) was announced. Grok-1.5V is able to process a wide variety of visual information, including documents, diagrams, graphs, screenshots, and photographs.[21] Grok-1.5V was never released to the public.

On May 4, 2024, Grok became available in the United Kingdom,[22] that being the only country in Europe to support Grok at the moment due to the impending Artificial Intelligence Act rules in the European Union. Grok was later reviewed by the EU and was released on May 16, 2024.[23]
